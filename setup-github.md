Follow these steps to publish your Merchant Fraud Dashboard to GitHub and enable automatic deployment.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer

## 🔧 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Using GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `merchant-fraud-dashboard`
3. **Description**: `A comprehensive React-based dashboard for e-commerce merchants to monitor fraud protection metrics with RBAC`
4. **Visibility**: Choose Public (recommended) or Private
5. **Initialize**: 
   - ❌ Don't add README (we already have one)
   - ❌ Don't add .gitignore (we already have one)
   - ✅ Add a license: MIT License
6. **Click**: "Create repository"

### Option B: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
gh repo create merchant-fraud-dashboard --public --description "Merchant Fraud Dashboard with RBAC"
```

## 🔗 Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with setup instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Add all files to git
git add .

# Make initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Merchant Fraud Dashboard with RBAC features

- Complete React dashboard with KPIs and analytics
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Analyst, Viewer)
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Comprehensive test suite
- Production-ready build configuration
- Automated deployment via GitHub Actions"

# Add GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/merchant-fraud-dashboard.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🌐 Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub
2. **Click**: Settings tab
3. **Scroll down**: to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
5. **Save**: The setting will be automatically saved

## 🚀 Step 4: Automatic Deployment

Your repository is now configured for automatic deployment! Here's what happens:

### ✅ Automatic Triggers
- **Every push** to `main` branch triggers deployment
- **Pull requests** trigger staging builds
- **GitHub Actions** handles the entire process

### 📍 Your Live URL
After the first deployment (takes 2-3 minutes), your app will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/merchant-fraud-dashboard/
```

### 🔍 Monitor Deployment
1. **Go to**: Actions tab in your repository
2. **Watch**: the deployment progress
3. **Check**: for any errors in the workflow

## 🎯 Step 5: Update Repository Information

### Add Repository Topics
1. **Go to**: your repository main page
2. **Click**: ⚙️ gear icon next to "About"
3. **Add topics**: `react`, `typescript`, `dashboard`, `fraud-detection`, `rbac`, `analytics`
4. **Website**: Add your GitHub Pages URL
5. **Save changes**

### Update README Links
Replace `yourusername` in README.md with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
# Find and replace in README.md
# yourusername → YOUR_ACTUAL_USERNAME
```

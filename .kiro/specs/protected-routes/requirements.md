# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Protected Routes feature will enhance the merchant fraud dashboard by implementing proper authentication-based route protection. Currently, users can directly access dashboard URLs without authentication, which poses a security risk. This feature will ensure that sensitive dashboard pages are only accessible to authenticated users, with automatic redirection to login for unauthorized access attempts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want dashboard routes to be protected by authentication, so that unauthorized users cannot access sensitive merchant data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access `/dashboard` THEN the system SHALL redirect them to `/login`
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access any protected route THEN the system SHALL redirect them to `/login`
3. WHEN an authenticated user accesses `/dashboard` THEN the system SHALL display the dashboard content
4. WHEN a user's authentication expires during a session THEN the system SHALL redirect them to `/login`

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a merchant user, I want to be automatically redirected to the dashboard after successful login, so that I can quickly access my fraud monitoring tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in from `/login` THEN the system SHALL redirect them to `/dashboard`
2. WHEN an authenticated user visits `/login` THEN the system SHALL redirect them to `/dashboard`
3. WHEN a user logs out from the dashboard THEN the system SHALL redirect them to `/login`
4. WHEN a user visits the root URL `/` THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the appropriate page based on authentication status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a merchant user, I want my authentication state to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to log in repeatedly during normal usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store authentication state persistently
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page while authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain their authenticated state
3. WHEN a user closes and reopens their browser within the session timeout THEN the system SHALL maintain their authenticated state
4. WHEN the authentication token expires THEN the system SHALL clear the authentication state and redirect to login

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable authentication context and protected route component, so that I can easily protect new routes as the application grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new protected routes THEN the system SHALL provide a reusable ProtectedRoute component
2. WHEN checking authentication status THEN the system SHALL provide a centralized authentication context
3. WHEN managing authentication state THEN the system SHALL use consistent patterns across all components
4. WHEN adding new protected routes THEN developers SHALL be able to wrap them with the ProtectedRoute component

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a merchant user, I want clear feedback during authentication state changes, so that I understand what's happening when I'm being redirected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is being verified THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
2. WHEN a redirect occurs due to authentication failure THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback
3. WHEN login is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable form interactions and show loading state
4. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
